# Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a sequence of Nodes which are connected to each other. Singly linked lists means there is only
one reference for each node unlike its brother doubly linked lists which has a reference to both the next and previous

## Challenge
This challenge asks us to build to classes. One is a linked list class which is a signly linked list connecting a series
nodes by just one reference, "next". The other class we create is a Node class which is each individual index of a
linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the TDD approach to this assignment using an iterative solution. By utilizing the tests, I slowly worked on solving the tests in order until
I had passed all the tests.
