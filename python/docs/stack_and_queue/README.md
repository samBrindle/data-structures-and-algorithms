# Stack and Queue
* Building classes for stacks and queues

## Code Challenge 10
* Create a class for stacks and a class for queues with the required behaviors

## Approach and Efficiency
* I chose to solve this challenge with iterative methods that walk through each element of the input
* Time was O(1) because time was not changed by input size
* Space was O(1) as well because we were only working with single nodes at a time so it did not change with input size
